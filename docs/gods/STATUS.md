It runs on the shared machine with no game-specific change; the three
platform fixes its boot path needed were made in PortForge and pinned
(`695bc65`).  The game runs its logic every other frame (30 Hz).

## What runs today

- **The original**, cold from power-on, on every recorded history.
- **The candidate `camera-sprites`** (`src/gods_sega/recovery.py`): the
  original with two gates armed, the camera follow step `002806` and the
  sprite emitter `0018C8`; `camera` and `sprites` arm each alone.

## Recorded histories (`history/gods/`, root `gods-usa-new`)

Eight player recordings, all from power-on, three of them branched from
checkpoints of an earlier one; 14,583 to 34,904 frames each, 107,519 frames
of tree edges in total (about thirty minutes of play).  The longest,
`fb408bc75597…` (the current `main`, score 261,208 at its end), goes well
beyond level 1; `f40d7bcc9dda…` reaches the right end of a wide level (the
camera's x limit).  Screenshots and labels are in the timeline
(`play.cmd --game gods`).  Retained evidence for the loop is pinned to node
ids, never to `main`:

| node | frames | what it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `f0ac19738f19…` | 15,148 | the reference for `segment_verify` (`artifacts/gods/evidence/main/reference.json`) and the retained boundary states at frames 6,000 and 12,000; the census `artifacts/gods/evidence/census-002806` |
| `fb408bc75597…` | 34,904 | census `census-002806-fb408bc75597` |
| `7251bbd0ecf7…` | 25,264 | census `census-002806-7251bbd0ecf7` |
| `f40d7bcc9dda…` | 17,620 | census `census-002806-f40d7bcc9dda` (the three x-limit path classes); `census-0018C8-f40d7bcc9dda` |
| `fb408bc75597…`, `7251bbd0ecf7…`, `f40d7bcc9dda…` | — | the sprite emitter's census `census-0018C8-<node>` (27, 32 and 30 path classes; 134 fixtures) |

## Evidence that passes

| claim | evidence | artifact |
|---|---|---|
| the original is reproducible: two fresh workers agree on every frame of every branch (state, video, PCM, counters) | `history-verify main --game gods --candidate original --tree` | `artifacts/gods/verify-tree-2026-09-15` (29,731 frames, the first two recordings); the eight-recording tree with the candidate below |
| the player's exit cache ends where a cold run ends; two retained real states continue identically for 300 frames | `history-run --cache` vs cold; `segment_verify --candidate original` | `tests/games/gods/test_recording.py` |
| **`002806` camera follow step**: the plan reproduces every fact of the original on all 61 retained fixtures (nine path classes over three recordings: hold/right/left × the x limit, and the y limit) | `factcheck check` on every fixture | `tests/games/gods/test_camera.py` |
| `camera` reproduces the original on the tree of all eight recordings: **PASS, 107,519 frames, 41,109 hits, 0 fallbacks, 734,968 instructions replaced**; on `f40d7bcc…` (the x-limit recording) PASS, 0 fallbacks | `history-verify main --candidate camera --tree`; `history-verify f40d7bcc9dda --candidate camera` | `artifacts/gods/verify-camera-tree-2026-09-16b`, `artifacts/gods/verify-camera-f40d7bcc` |
| the negative control diverges at the first tick that enters the routine | `--candidate camera-mutant-result` | `artifacts/gods/verify-camera-mutant` (frame 329 on `f0ac1973…`), `verify-camera-mutant-f40d7bcc` (frame 1,540) |
| **`0018C8` sprite emitter**: the plan reproduces every fact of the original on all 134 retained fixtures over three recordings (off-screen x/y, cache hit after 1–8 slots, cache miss into an empty slot or the ninth; a miss is a seam: the prefix is checked to the VDP control write, the suffix from the resume) | `factcheck check` on every fixture (`MATCH (seam ...)` for the miss arm) | `tests/games/gods/test_sprites.py` |
| `sprites` reproduces the original on `f0ac1973…`: **PASS, 15,148 frames, 40,935 hits (13,218 seams entered, 13,108 completed), 306 scheduler refusals, 0 foreign returns**; `camera-sprites` on the tree of all eight recordings: **PASS, 107,519 frames, 306,295 hits, 82,757 seams entered, 81,822 completed, 344 seam deadlines, 1,733 scheduler refusals, 9,443,248 instructions replaced** | `history-verify f0ac19738f19 --candidate sprites`; `history-verify main --candidate camera-sprites --tree` | `artifacts/gods/verify-sprites-f0ac1973b`, `artifacts/gods/verify-camera-sprites-tree-2026-09-16b` |
| both sprite negative controls diverge at the first gameplay frame (a stored byte off; `d0` off in every admitted plan, which breaks the VDP command the machine reads at the seam) | `--candidate sprites-mutant-result`, `sprites-mutant-register` | `artifacts/gods/verify-sprites-mutant-result`, `verify-sprites-mutant-register` (frame 429) |
| the suite: `scripts/run_tests.py gods` (common + Gods), about 25 s | 337 tests | — |

The fallbacks that remain on the tree are all exact by construction: a
`scheduler admission` refusal is the native scheduler declining a plan or a
suffix because an interrupt is due inside its span (about one per cent of
`0018C8`'s activations; the original runs it), and a `seam deadline` is the
frame's observation instant falling inside the ceded upload loop (the
committed prefix stands; the original finishes the activation).  Neither
is an arm the candidate declined.

Declined on purpose (the original runs them): the two negative clamps of
the camera step (`002822`, `00283A`) and the flipped-sprite arm of the
emitter (`001928`/`00199C`, sprite ids with bit 15 set), which no recording
has entered through `0018C8`.

## What is not recovered

Everything else.  Two routines are recovered: the camera follow step
(`game/camera.py`, six words) and the sprite emitter (`game/sprites.py`:
the sprite list at `FFEBF6`–`FFEBFF`, the per-frame tile cache at
`FFEE98`/`FFEEAA`, the dynamic-tile cursor `FFEE84`, the ROM descriptor
table `066794` indexed through `0019D2`).  The emitter's siblings
(`001164`, `001256`/`001260`/`00126A`, `001312`) share its descriptor
layout and list conventions but are not recovered.  There is no
object-table convention, no semantic map, no native runtime, no
sound-driver knowledge.  The seam for a platform operation inside a region
exists and is shared (`src/genesis_re/seam.py`); Gods has one seam plan.

## Next bites

From the callee census of 600 gameplay frames
(`artifacts/gods/census/hot-calls-6000-6600.json`, `f0ac1973…` frames
6,000–6,600), RAM-only and executed every game tick — census each over the
longest recordings before choosing:

| entry | calls / 600 frames | length | what the trace shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0049DA` | 300 | 19 | a scan of four 6-byte slots at `FFF39A` for a negative word; leaves the index in D7; no writes |
| `004150` | 301 | 38 (3,806 cycles) | the table clear below `FFC1BA` by `movem` bursts: up to 0x200 bytes written (the atomic limit is 2,048) |
| `00FDB8` | 600 | 27 | from `00FC08`: a 6-byte record appended at A5 from the ROM table at `00885E` |
| `002806` | 300 | 17–21 | recovered (`camera`) |
| `0018C8` | 742 | 10–145 | recovered (`sprites`): the dynamic sprite emitter with a per-frame tile cache; a miss uploads the tiles inline (`001974`–`001988`), the first Gods seam |
| `00126A` (`001256`, `001260`) | 412 | 305–307 | from `010248` (the particle drawer's jump table at `0100F2`): the emitter's sibling without the cache — the same seam shape (record composition, inline upload `0012F4`–`001308`, restore) |
| `001164` | 1,015 | 13–40 | the emitter's RAM-only sibling: bounds test, a record from the same descriptor table with a fixed tile word, the list-full guard at `FFEE30` (six callers) |
| `001164` | 1,015 | 13–40 | the screen-bounds test before a sprite record is emitted (six callers) |

Deferred, not first candidates: `003BEC` (the tile-pair VDP writer inside
the map streaming interpreter `003158`/`003480`, which does not return
within a frame), `0F4472`/`0F44AA` (the sound-command transfer into the Z80
window `A01F80`, called from the VBlank handler), anything under the
VBlank handler (`0003DC`), `001098` (the per-tick sprite-list flush: two VDP
blocks with RAM work between them — a platform tail from its first block
would recover 13 instructions).  Sound requests in Gods are RAM writes
into the command block `FFFDEA` (`0F446C`); the transfer to the Z80 is the
VBlank handler's, so a region that requests a sound is RAM-only here.

## Open questions

- An address error during play on 15 September (PC `012E46`: the second
  tracked object record's index at `FFF01E` was −1 while `FFF378` still held
  its pointer) could not be reproduced; the session's inputs were lost.  A
  session that faults now preserves its inputs as a node
  (`reason: execution_failure`); if it recurs, resume that node and step
  once.  The precondition is ordinary play: the recordings `f40d7bcc…`,
  `7251bbd0…` and `fb408bc7…` set `FFF378` (92, 67 and 1 times) and two of
  them retire the record once (`004AE2` writes −1 to `FFF01E`) without
  faulting; the fault needs the retire to fall between the pointer's
  computation (`008306`) and its use (`012DD6`).  Whether that ordering is
  the game's own or a machine timing effect is open until it is recorded.

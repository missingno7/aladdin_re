"""Exact outer effects of recovered Gods regions over the live machine; semantics are in ``game``.

A planner reads the parked machine at a region's entry and returns the
``AtomicPlan`` the shared adapter admits as one operation: the RAM bytes,
the register file at the exit, and the original's instruction and cycle
cost along the executed path.  Anything a recording has not witnessed is
declined with ``UnsupportedCandidate`` and the original runs it.
